# This is a full stack MERN project utilizing Mongo DB, Express, React and Node. 

I have created a small recreation of an ecourse site which includes a log-in page and seperate views and privelages based on log in credentials.

This site uses API Keys, useState,UseEffect, and Routes to help create a dashboard page that showcases student assignments, class progress and more.

There is an option to log into the site as as either student or teacher , which creates a different experience.
While students may view upcoming assignments, credentials attatched to an instructor will allow the option to create and post new assignments. This was set up utilizing conditional statements within react.


Check out the full site here:

Use the login credentials below to check out the site as student and/or as a teacher. (The email is from a json placement holder and does not exist)
